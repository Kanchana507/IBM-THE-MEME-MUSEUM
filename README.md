# IBM-THE-MEME-MUSEUM
A meme museum is a digital or physical space to showcase popular internet memes, their origins, and their cultural significance. Visitors can explore and create memes through interactive experiences. The project aims to explore the cultural impact of memes and preserve these ephemeral artefacts for future generations.
